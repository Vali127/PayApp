# Welcome to PayApp
Hello, this project is a **school project** that we were assigned for our 2nd year here as CS students.

it is developped with **C#** and the frameWork **Avalonia UI** -*which is very good btw*- . The app aims to **manage salary payment for employees** , buuut...like our school expect more than that from us (juding our past projects), it also takes few functionnalities than just managing salary payment...
